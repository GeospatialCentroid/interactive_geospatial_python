The following jupyter notebooks have been adapted from the carpentries material [Introduction to Geospatial Raster and Vector Data with Python](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/geospatial-python/)

Episodes 5-7, and 9 have been covered:
* 5 Access satellite imagery using Python
* 6 Read and visualize raster data
* 7 Vector data in Python
* 9 Raster Calculations in Python

Each with a working and complete notebook for use in workshop instruction.

*Special attention has been given to using interactive plots for choosing both points of interest (POI) and areas of interest (AOI)*

*The last episode 'Raster Calculations in Python' has also been adaped for classifying NDVI over mulitple years, and saving both the generated geotiffs and output statistics of each year.* 


**For these notebooks to work, a 'geospatial' environment must we created which includes all the necessary libraries.**

With [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) installed the following steps can be used to create this environment:

1. From the Anaconda Navigator click the "Environments" button on the left.
1. Then from the bottom of the screen, click Import.
1. From the popup that appears, click the folder icon next to the local drive text field and choose "environment.yaml" (downloaded as part of this repo).
1. Accept the default name, then click the "Import" button from the popup and wait while the environment is created.
1. Make sure the "geospatial" environment is selected and then launch jupyter lab

Alternate virtual environment creation instructions can be found here [Software Setup](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/geospatial-python/index.html#software-setup).
